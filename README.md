Welcome to my Ring Savvy application project! 

Summary
In this project, you will be able to input the ISBM of a book to add to your visable collection that can be star rated. There are shades of Bootstrap to add some more style to the project. You will also see a 6 card per row display when books are added to your collection.

Functionality

This project displays basic CRUD commands such as being able to create, read, update, and delete books at ease. The project saves the state of your project whenever you add a new book, delete a book, or update the star rating of a book. If a user inputs a non-validated ISBM, the user will get a notification that there input is invalid. There is no capacity to how many books the user may add. 

Style

Whenever you hover over the ISBM input bar, you can see that the text book moves up slightly. This helps users trying to interact with the field correctly identify that they are clicking the right field and that it is responisve. There is also a hover animation on the "Add Book" button that creates a dark shadow underneath the button. This is again to help the user correctly identify what they are trying to interact with.

conclusion

I hope you enjoy my project and please feel free to reach out to me if you need anything.
